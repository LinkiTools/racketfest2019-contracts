# Introduction to Contracts - Racketfest 2019

## Abstract

I have two children - the oldest who is not named after a big toilet paper company and 
the youngest who is not named after an operating system had no boundaries until contracts came along.
Come with me on a journey into
the land of contracts and how they helped me to get these children to bed on time,
so I can then have some more time for Racket. If you pay attention, you might even
learn some cool things about the contract system in Racket - in addition to the 
contract system I have implemented in my own home.

When Jesse, RacketFest Supremo Leader, asked for an abstract for this tutorial
he expected something serious. Instead, he got this! If only he had imposed some contracts on the abstract request he would have gotten something better or at least someone to blame!

Come along and learn how to use, reuse, misuse, and disuse the Racket contract system.
It might turn out to be a great way to help you develop great reliable software and even 
get your kids to bed on time.
